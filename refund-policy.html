        <p>
            Please read this policy to understand how refunds and cancellations are
            handled for digital products purchased from Nxone Tech.
        </p>

            <h2>Nature of our products</h2>
            <p>
                Nxone Tech sells digital products that are delivered instantly as
                downloadable files after successful payment. No physical products are
                shipped.
            </p>

            <h2>No automatic refunds</h2>
            <p>
                Because digital files cannot be “returned”, we do not offer automatic
                refunds once a product has been successfully delivered and downloaded.
            </p>

            <h2>Situations where we may help</h2>
            <p>
                In special cases, you can contact us within 7 days of purchase if:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You were charged but did not receive any download link or file</li>
                <li>The file is completely corrupted or cannot be opened at all</li>
                <li>You were accidentally charged twice for the same product</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In such cases, please email <strong>support@nxone.tech</strong> with your
                order details. We will review the issue and may provide a replacement file
                or a refund at our discretion.
            </p>

            <h2>Order cancellation</h2>
            <p>
                Orders cannot be cancelled once payment is completed and the download
                link has been sent to you.
            </p>
