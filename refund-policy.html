    <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

    <p>
        Nxone Tech sells digital products that are delivered instantly via download links after
        successful payment.
    </p>

    <h2>No automatic refunds</h2>
    <p>
        Because our products are digital and cannot be “returned”, we generally do not offer
        automatic refunds once the files have been downloaded.
    </p>

    <h2>Exceptions</h2>
    <p>
        In special cases, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are charged but do not receive the download link</li>
        <li>The file is completely corrupted or cannot be opened</li>
        <li>You are accidentally charged twice for the same product</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        you can contact us within 7 days of purchase at <strong>support@nxone.tech</strong> with
        your order details. We will review the issue and may offer a replacement file or refund
        at our discretion.
    </p>

    <h2>Order cancellation</h2>
    <p>
        Orders cannot be cancelled after payment is completed and the download link has been
        sent to you.
