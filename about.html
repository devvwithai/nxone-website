        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Nxone Tech is a small digital products brand, focused on simple and useful
            downloadable resources for students, gamers and creators.
        </p>

            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>
                Nxone Tech started as a personal side project with one simple goal:
                to create digital files that are easy to use in everyday life. Instead
                of long and complicated material, our focus is on clean layouts,
                short explanations and practical designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The store will mainly offer:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>PDF eBooks and short guides</li>
                <li>Printable and digital sticker packs</li>
                <li>Planners, journals and trackers</li>
                <li>Basic templates for notes and content planning</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Every file is created with attention to clarity, readability and a
                minimal aesthetic that works both on screen and on paper.
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3>What “digital only” means</h3>
            <p>
                Nxone Tech does not ship any physical products. All items sold through
                this website will be delivered as digital files (like PDF or PNG) that
                customers can download and use on their device or print at home.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:0.82rem;color:#9ca3af;">
                This also means there are no courier charges or shipping delays.

            A few core principles that guide the store and the products we publish.

                    Content is written in simple English so that it is easy to follow,
                    even for beginners.

                <h3>Small but consistent</h3>
                <p>
                    Instead of hundreds of low-quality items, we prefer to release fewer
                    products and keep improving them over time.

                <h3>Respect for privacy</h3>
                <p>
                    We collect only the minimum information needed to complete an order
                    and support the customer.
